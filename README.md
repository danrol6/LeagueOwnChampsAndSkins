# **League of Legends Random Champion and Skin Picker**

## Overview
The League of Legends Random Champion and Skin Picker is an app that gathers all the champions available from the official League of Legends API. The app will then use the list of champions to download the list of skins available from another official League of Legends API. Finally, the app will download the skins of each champion and save it to each corresponding folder, creating it if it does not exist. 

In working progress... The app will gather a list of champions and skins the user owns and will randomize a champion, along with its skin, for the user to play as.
